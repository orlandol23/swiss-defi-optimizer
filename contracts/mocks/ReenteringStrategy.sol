/**
 * @title ReenteringStrategy
 * @notice A strategy that re-enters the vault during `withdraw`. Test-only.
 * @dev Exists to prove that `Vault.setStrategy` is guarded. A strategy is an
 *      owner-chosen contract, but "the owner chose it" is not a security
 *      property: the strategy still runs arbitrary code while the vault waits
 *      on it. This one returns less than it was asked for and makes up the
 *      difference by depositing the vault's own assets back into the vault,
 *      which inflates the balance delta the vault measures and would mint
 *      shares that were never paid for. With `nonReentrant` on the entry point
 *      the re-entrant `deposit` reverts, so the whole call reverts.
 *
 *      Written to pass the same Slither gate as production code: an attacker
 *      mock that needs the gate relaxed to compile is a mock that quietly
 *      widens what the gate lets through.
